I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the word.

Truth be told,I never graduated from collage.

And this is the colsest I've ever gotten to a collage graduation.

Today I want to you three stories from my life.

That's it ,No big deal ,just three stories.

The first story is about commecting the dots.

I dropped out of Read Collage after the first 6 months.

But then stayed around as a drap-in for another 18 months also before I realy quit.

So why did I dropout.

It started before was born.

My biological mother was young unwed collage graduate student.

and she decided to put me up for adoption.

She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by collage graduates

So everything was all set,

for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

Except that when I popped out.

They decided at the last minute that they really wanted agirl.

So my parents who were on a waiting list.

Got a call in the middle of the night.

Asking we got an unexpected baby boy.

Do you want him. They said of course.

My biological monther found out later.

That my monther had never graduated from collage.

And my father had never graduated from high school.

She refused to sign the find adoption papers.

She only relented afew months later.

When my parents promised that I would go to collage.

This was a start in my life.

And 17 years later I did go to collage.

But I naiverly chose that was almost as expensive as Stanlord.

And all of my working-class parents'savings Were being spent on my collage tuition.

After six months I couldn't see the value in it.

I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

And no idea how collage was going to help me figure it out.

And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.

It was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

The minute I dropped out. I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me.

And begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

It wasn't all romantic I didn't have a dorm room.

So I slept on the floor in friends'rooms.

I returned coke bottles for the 5 cent deposits to buy food with ,

and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night.

To get one good meal a week at the Have Krishna temple. I loved it.

And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition,

turned out to be priceless later on.

Let me give you one example.

Read Collage at that time offered. Perhaps the best calligraphy in struction in the country.

Throughout the compus every poster.

Every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligrapher.

Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes.

I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.

I learned about serif and san-serif typefaces,

About varying the amount of space between different letter combinations,

About whatmakes great typography great.--

It was beartiful,historical

artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture

And I found it fascinating

None of this had even a hope

Of any practical application in my life

But ten years later

When we were designing the first Macintosh computer

It all came back to me

And we designed it all into the Mac

It was the first computer with beautiful typography

If I had never dropped in on that single course in collage

The Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts

And since Windows just copied the Mac

It's likely that no personal computer would have them

If hadnever dropped out

I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class and personal computers might not have.

The wonderful typography that they do.

Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in collage

But it was very very clear looking backwards ten years later.

Again you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards

So you have to trust that.

The dots will somehow connect in your future.

You have to trust in something.

Your gut,destiny,life,karma whatever.

Because believing that these dots would connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart.

even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.

> Second

My second story is about love and loss.

I was lucky.

I found what I loved to do early in life

Wiz and I started Apple in my parent's garage when I was 20

We worked hard and in 10 years Apple had grown

From just the two of us in a garage

Into a S2 billion company with over 4000 employees

We just released our finest creation The Macintosh a year earlier

And I had just turned 30 and then I got fired

How can you get fired from a company you started

Well as Apple grew we hired someone

Who I thought was very talented to run the company with me

And for the first year or so things went well

But then our visions of the future began to diverge

And eventually we had a falling out

When we did our Board of Directors sided with him

So at 30 I was out and very publicly out

What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastaing

I really didn't know what to do for a few months

I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down

That I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me

I met with David Packard and Bob nonce

And tried to apologize for screwing up so badly

I was a very public failure

And even thought about running away from the valley

But something slowly began to dawn on me

I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit

I had been rejected but I was still in love and so I decided to start over...

I didn't see it then. But it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happend to me.

The heaviness of being successful was replaced By the lightness of being a beginner again Less sure about everything

It freed me to enter One of the most creative periods of my life

During the next five years I started a company named NeXT Another company named Pixar.

And fell in love with an amazing woman Who would become my wife.

Pixar went on to create the word's first computer Animated feature film 'Toy Story'

And is now the most successful animation studio in the word

In a remarkable turn of events Apple bought NeXT I returned to Apple

And the technology we developed at NeXT Is at the heart of Apple's curent renaissance

And Laurence and I have a wonderful family together

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened

If I hadn't been fired from Apple

It was awful tasting medicine But I guess the patient needed it

Sometimes life hits you In the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

I'm convinced that the only thing That kept me going was that I loved what I did

You've got to find what you love

And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers

Your work is going to fill a large part of your life

And the only way to be truly satisfied is to do

What you believe is great work

And the only way to do great work is to love what you do

If you haven't found it yet, Keep looking Don't settle

As with all matters of the heart, You'll know when you find it

And like any great relationship

It just gets better and better as the years roll on

So keep looking Don't settle

> Third

My third story is about death

When I was 17 I read a quote that went something like

'If you live each day as if it was you last someday you'll most certainly be right'

It made an impression on me and since then for the past33 years

I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself

"If today was the last day of my life Would I want to do what I am about to do today"

And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row

I know I need to change something

Remembering that I'll be dead soon

Is the most important tool I've ever encountered To help me make the big choices in life

Because almost everything

All ecternal expectations all pride all fear of embarrassment or failure

These things just fall away in the face of death

Leaving only what id truly important

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

You are already naked There is no reason not to follow your heart

About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer

I had a scan at 7'30 in the morning

And it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas

I didn't even know what a pancreas was

The doctors told me this was almost certainly

A type of cancer that is incurable

And that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months

My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order

Which is doctor's code for prepare to die

It means to try to tell your kids everything

You thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months

It means to make sure everything is buttoned up

So that it will be as easy as possible for your family

It means to say your goodbyes

I lived with that diagnosis all days

Later that evening I had a biopay

Where they stuck an endoscope down my throat

Through my stomach and into my intestines

Put needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor

I was sedated but my wife who was there

Told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope

The doctors started crying

Because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer

That is curable with surgery

I had the surgery and thankfully I'm fine now

This was the closest I've been to facing death

And I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades

Having lived through it

I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty

Than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept

No one wants to die even people who want to go to heaven

Don't want to die to get there

And yet death is the destination we all share

No one has ever escaped it and that is as it should be

Because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life

It is Life's change agent

It clears out the old to make way for the new

Right now the new is you

But someday not too long from now

You will gradually become the old and be cleared away

Sorry to be so dramatic but it is quite true

Your time is limited

So don't waste it living someone else's life

Don't be trapped by dogma

Which is living with the results of other people's thinking

Don't let the noise of others'opinions drown out your own inner voice

And most important.

Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition

They somehow already know what you truly want to become, Everything else is secondary.

> summarize

When I was young

Amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog

Which was one of the bibles of my generation

It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand Not for from here in Menlo Park

And he brought it to life with his poetic touch

This was in the late 1960's Before personal computers and desktop publishing

So it was all made with typewriters Scissors and Polaroid cameras

It was sort of like Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along

It was idealistic

And overllowing with neat tools and great notions

Stewart and his team put out Several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog

And then when it had run its course they put out a final issue

It was the mid-1970s and I was your age

On the bcak cover of their final issue was

A photograph of an early morning country road

The kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on If you were so adventurous

Beneath it were the words " Stay Hungry Stay Foolish "

It was their farewell message as they signed off " Stay Hungry Stay Foolish "

And I have always wished that for myself

And now as you graduate to begin anew

I wish that for you

Stay Hungry Stay Foolish

Thank you all very much
